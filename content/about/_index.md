![Profile image of Matt Lilley]({{< rel url="img/matt.jpg" >}})

Welcome to my blog ðŸ‘‹! I'm Matt Lilley, a physicist, technologist and educator with an attitude of:
- If I donâ€™t know it, Iâ€™ll learn it
- If it doesnâ€™t exist, Iâ€™ll build it

and so here I write about what I'm learning and building. I mostly keep this as a recordâ€”otherwise, I'd probably forget half the things I've worked on. I do also hope that if you come across my website you enjoy reading my posts and get something useful from them - that would be a nice bonus ðŸ˜„. I focus on [science]({{< relref "/tags/science" >}}), [technology]({{< relref "/tags/technology" >}}) and [education]({{< relref "/tags/education" >}}). From the mysteries of [quantum physics]({{< relref "/series/solid-state-nuclear-science" >}}) and the challenges of [cold fusion]({{< relref "/series/cold-fusion-lenr" >}}), to [tech education]({{< relref "/posts/taste-of-tech" >}}) and the [potential of GPT]({{< relref "/tags/gpt" >}}).  I've also got a [series on guesstimation]({{< relref "/series/guesstimation" >}}) that invites you to solve seemingly impossible problems like "how many people are picking their nose right now?" ðŸ¤”.


Ok, now a little bit more about me and my work.

For nearly a decade, I worked in academia [researching fusion energy]({{< relref "/posts/magnetic-confinement-fusion-instabilities" >}}), nonlinear dynamics, and instabilities. Alongside my research, I lectured advanced mathematics and electromagnetic waves to PhD and masterâ€™s students, mentored at all academic levels, and presented internationally ðŸ¤“.

Driven by a desire for self-funded research, I founded Level 8 Limited in 2013, taught myself to code, and built [Squidler]({{< relref "/posts/squidler" >}}), a cross-platform app. I've continued to build all kinds of things since then: productivity tools like [Slidee]({{< relref "/posts/slidee" >}}), [Swipee]({{< relref "/posts/swipee" >}}) and [Flashee]({{< relref "/posts/flashee" >}}), [automation bots]({{< relref "/posts/back-in-stock" >}}) and [interactive simulations]({{< relref "/posts/constrained-particles" >}}). I code today because it's fun - there's nothing quite like the thrill of seeing your code creations come to life! You can check out a few of my completed projects on my portfolio site, [lilley.io](https://lilley.io).

My passion for education extended beyond academiaâ€”since 2017 Iâ€™ve since facilitated 153 workshops for business leaders on topics like blockchain, AI, machine learning, and quantum computing.

Iâ€™ve also helped people launch their careers in tech (student recommendations onÂ [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-lilley/)) and have launched a weekend-long learning experience called [Taste of Tech]({{< relref "/posts/taste-of-tech" >}}), designed to help people figure out if a career in tech is right for them.

More recently, Iâ€™ve [re-engaged with physics]({{< relref "/posts/returning-to-physics" >}}) full time through a collaboration with MIT and the Anthropocene Institute on [nucleonics]({{< relref "/series/nucleonics" >}}) researchâ€”a new field exploring nuclear state manipulation. This work pushes the boundaries of solid-state fusion and could redefine how we think about energy at the fundamental level. Itâ€™s either groundbreaking or, at the very least, an excellent excuse to geek out over quantum mechanics again.

Outside of my website, I create physics content on [YouTube (Casual Physics)](https://www.youtube.com/CasualPhysics) - like and subscribe ðŸ¤£.

Ok, that's all from me - thanks for reading all the way down to the bottom.
