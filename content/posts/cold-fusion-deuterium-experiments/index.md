It's been some months since the [Deuterium drama]({{< relref "/posts/cold-fusion-deuterium-drama" >}}) almost put a stop to my cold fusion experiments. Luckily, I was still able to run a couple of experiments in January and the results were extremely encouraging.

Since then, I've been working hard to try and rule out any prosasic explanations for the "excess heat" that I think I've observed in the higher than expected temperature readings.

If you've followed along with my [experimental log](https://gitlab.com/mklilley/lenr/-/issues), you'll know it took quite a bit of effort to finally nail the culprit - AC voltage fluctuations in my heating pad.

Today, I finally got around to performing a deuterium experiment using a stable DC power supply and the results confirmed my suspicion - no excess heat, no cold fusion.

Obviously I'm a bit disappointed, but really only a smidgen. I've learnt a TONNE since I [started this experimental adventure]({{< relref "/posts/cold-fusion-becoming-experimentalist" >}}) and I've met some great collaborators along with way. Hugely thankful to Alan Smith and Ed Storms in particular - I would not have been able to get this far without your support 🙏.

And how did the expenses stack up in the end I hear you say? You may recall, the original idea was the build something for under £1000. Including the heavy water, total money spent = £4300, total life experience gained = priceless 😊.
