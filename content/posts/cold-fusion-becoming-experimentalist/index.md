[A month ago]({{< relref "/posts/cold-fusion-rabbit-hole" >}}), I committed myself to making some local cold fusion connections by placing somewhat cryptic posters in London university physics departments. I was delighted to receive some emails and had some great follow up conversations with curious, open-minded physicists.

One of the physicists was also an entrepreneurial character. He politely critiqued my proposition of needing Â£10M to make cold fusion a reality. To paraphrase, "No one is going to give you Â£10M. What can you demonstrate for Â£1000?" ðŸ˜± .

Now, I'm not an experimentalist by trade (my [academic fusion research]({{< relref "/posts/magnetic-confinement-fusion-instabilities" >}}) was largely theoretical) but Â£1000 seemed ludicrously small to me. I took his advice seriously though - he is an experimentalist after all (built his own Fusor like the one I was interested in [back in 2014]({{< relref "/posts/fusor-star-mode" >}})). 

After digging around in the literature I came across work ofÂ Les Case [^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]. He made cold fusion happen in a pressurised container of deuterium gas at 3.4 atmospheres at 200C with palladium on coconut shell carbon. The [set-up](http://www.lenr-canr.org/acrobat/MalloveEreproducib.pdf) seemed "simple":

![Les Case's cold fusion experiment](les-case-experiment.png "Dr. Les Caseâ€™s Catalytic Fusion cell, a steel gas-tight oval container used as an oxygen bottle in WW-II, sits in resistance coil heating basket")

surely even a theorist like me could pull this off!

So, this is the task I've charged myself with - to replicate the work of Les Case. It's going to be an exciting journey which I hope you will be part of by following my [experimental log](https://gitlab.com/mklilley/lenr/-/issues/1).
