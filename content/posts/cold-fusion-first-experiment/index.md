Yesterday I did my first cold fusion experiment. I've been working up to this since I decided to [become an experimentalist]({{< relref "/posts/cold-fusion-becoming-experimentalist" >}}) back in 2017. Needless to say I was incredibly excited. 

Up to now, I've been sharing detailed progress on my [experimental log](https://gitlab.com/mklilley/lenr/-/issues/1) and snippets on [CasualPhysics on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CasualPhysics). Today, I'm starting to also document my journey on [CasualPhysics on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjvHqB5pIFEzQ7qfOdoxW60B0F7OThnW-).

Right now, you can see how I prepared the materials for this first experiment:

and you can see what my cold fusion reactor looks like and how it works:

Two big questions remain:
1. Did I make cold fusion happen?
2. Did I manage to stick to my Â£1000 budget?

My spending is currently sitting at around Â£2000. I'm not too upset about it though. I'm new to this whole experimental game and I know a lot of the overspending was because I was learning as I was doing.

Did I make cold fusion happen? I saw a 5C rise in temperature above the baseline using a [hybrid of the Les Case and Mizuno work]({{< relref "/posts/cold-fusion-coconut-conundrum" >}}) - this suggests there was an extra source of heat coming from inside the reactor. I'm using hydrogen not deuterium, so this result was surprising. Many variables to consider and a full analysis will have to wait until after my holiday. Cliff hanger ðŸ¤£.
